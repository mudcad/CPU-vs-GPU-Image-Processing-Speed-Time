# CPU vs GPU Image Processing Benchmark

This project benchmarks and compares **CPU** and **GPU** performance for simple image operations using **PyTorch**.  

It generates random images of different sizes, processes them, and measures average runtimes on CPU and GPU.  

Finally, it plots a graph for easy comparison.
